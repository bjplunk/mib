Modular IRC Bot is an irc bot written in python, intended to be easy to extend
and customize.

MIB is licensed under the MIT License (see LICENSE for details).

To start MIB, simply invoke the main.py script. MIB is intended to be used with
Python 3.2 and up, but might work for older 3 versions as well.

To extend the bot's functionality you can create modules. Modules are located
in src/modules/. Inside of said directory you will find a README file
describing the process.
